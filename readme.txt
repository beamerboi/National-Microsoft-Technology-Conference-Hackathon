Pixel is basically a blind personal assistant, aiming to help blind people through their daily difficulties, we have inspired by our special invited guest Mr Ahmed Ghorbel, and we have noticed the challenges that they are facing everyday if they had nobody by their sides, Pixel is going to be your guide into your new life experience, I believe you are wondering about how can it get this done, right? So let me get right into the point and introduce our interesting features, I am going everytime to pose a problem and we are going to explain how Pixel is going to help, So first let's start with the easiest one. Let's face it, blind people are somehow used to their environment and if nothing changed they are able to do their own stuffs without the need of an external caregiver, but when somehow something new pops up they really need a HELP, and this is when the Object Detection AI of Pixel is going give a hand, it basically gonna make it easier through saying each thing that it can detect around you, next we know that blind people wants sometimes to have a reading session but what about their next favorite book that has no blind accessibility, Pixel is giving a Text Detection AI and basically is going to do the job for you. Third we know that blind people use colors in their daily life for different usabilities, this is the moment when Color Detection AI is going to show up and get you covered, and fourth we can't deny that blind people are also in a danger of having infected by corona from an external source, so Pixel is going to make sure that your interview or your meeting partner is wearing their mask, fifth, blind people are getting scammed everyday by some buyers that use their disability to get some extra cash, Pixel is getting step forward here into making your payment more secure and efficient through making an online payment using a QR Code, and finally the most amazing part of our beloved Pixel, IIIIIIS making sure that everything you drink or whether you eat is not having an expired date, since we know that this can get you poisoned so Pixel is saying NO to that just call me out buddy and i will check the date for you and i would tell you whether it is safe to eat or not.
This is basically the general use of Pixel, and what we loved about it, is making everything simple to use, this is the challenge here, cause we couldn't find this anywhere else, Pixel is depending on just "Hey Pixel" call to start their job, and having your back covered.
We are sorry we couldn't make it to make an UI but we could make it to get the code done, most of it it is working, if there is any issue with the main one, just get into the other folders and have a little time testing them.
There might be some issues with the main, but each fonction works in its own path, you can check it on its folder
The main folder is the container of the whole app.
you can run the app using base anaconda or a virutal environment you can install the the packages using pip, the packages will be mentioned in the terminal when the code crashs.
We have used the Tensorflow object detection API, Keras, tesseract, opencv, and SpeechRecongition.
Made with love and so much pain in less than 20Hours
